*Note that all audio and video files are dummies and need to be replaced for
actual ingests*

adjusted at the top of the file. If the video file does not exist, the user is
asked to enter a file name.

Ingest files using multiple requests, ingesting metadata, audio and video files
separately. Parameters can be adjusted at the top of the file.
